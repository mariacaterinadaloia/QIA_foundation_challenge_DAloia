# Welcome!✨
This is my entry for [Quantum Internet Application Challenge 2024](https://github.com/QuTech-Delft/QIA-foundation-challenge-2024/?tab=readme-ov-file), the objective of this challenge is to implement an **Anonymous Bit Transmission Protocol** Using [SquidASM](https://squidasm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html). 
### how did I manage to implement this protocol?🧐
Firstly, I've read all the documentation and watched the provided [tutorials about SquidASM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwDG3ecU24s&list=PL5jmbd6SJYnMW3p28I5CUBK8kC6b9wHjs&index=3), [the paper provided by QIA foundation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0409201) and the [image provided]() to explain the structure of the requested protocol. 
## 💡Anonymous Bit Transmission Protocol💡
The initial structure is provided on the GitHub repository already linked. The challenge is divided in tasks. 
### Task 1️⃣:
> The first task is to implement the protocol for anonymous transmission of a classical bit. The protocol is described in the Quantum Anonymous Transmissions paper (see page 10).
> For convenience, an image with the protocol definition, anonymous transmission classical bit.png is included in this repository. In this protocol, d represents the bit being transmitted anonymously.
> To complete this goal, implement the protocol in the anonymous_transmit_bit method within application.py. The provided template and helper properties, like next_node_name, prev_node_name, next_socket, etc., that will assist you.
