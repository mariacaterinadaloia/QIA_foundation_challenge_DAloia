# Welcome!‚ú®
This is my entry for [Quantum Internet Application Challenge 2024](https://github.com/QuTech-Delft/QIA-foundation-challenge-2024/?tab=readme-ov-file), the objective of this challenge is to implement an **Anonymous Bit Transmission Protocol** Using [SquidASM](https://squidasm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html). 
### how did I manage to implement this protocol?üßê
Firstly, I've read all the documentation and watched the provided [tutorials about SquidASM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwDG3ecU24s&list=PL5jmbd6SJYnMW3p28I5CUBK8kC6b9wHjs&index=3), [the paper provided by QIA foundation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0409201) and the [image provided]() to explain the structure of the requested protocol.
